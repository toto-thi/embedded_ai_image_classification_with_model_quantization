# How Quantization Mechanism Used?

![PTQ](figures/PTQ.png)

This project develops an image classification model on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, focusing on optimizing the model through 8-bit quantization for deployment on resource-limited hardware. Preprocessing steps prepare real-time images from a camera sensor by resizing, normalizing, and transforming them into a 784-dimensional input vector. The model is converted to an 8-bit format using TensorFlow Lite's post-training quantization, reducing memory usage significantly. This quantization process is essential for fitting the model within the Arduino Nanoâ€™s memory constraints while retaining high classification accuracy achieving efficient and responsive image classification.
